## External Fractalide Repository Example

This repository demonstrates how to create a specialized repository independent of the Fractalide canonical repo.
You're encouraged to copy this repo and put it under new revision control.

Components may be closed source if needed.

### Contracts

Contracts in this repository are not communicated to the canonical `gitlab.com/fractalide/fractalide` therefore you are encouraged to commit repo boundary crossing contracts to the conanical repo contracts folder.
